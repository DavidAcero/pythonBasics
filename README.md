There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List       : collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple      : collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set        : collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary : collection which is ordered and changeable. No duplicate members.

===== LIST ======
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Lists are created using square brackets
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
List items are indexed

===== TUPLES ======
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A tuple is a collection which is ordered, unchangeable and allow duplicate values.
Tuples are written with round brackets.
Tuple items are indexed.

===== SET ======
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A set is a collection which is both unordered, unchangeable and unindexed.
Sets are written with curly brackets.
Sets cannot have two items with the same value.

===== DICTIONARIES ======
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and does not allow duplicates.
Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:
